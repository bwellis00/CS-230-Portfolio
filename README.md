# Gaming Room Software Design Document ReadMe

## Client and Software Requirements:
The client for this project was "The Gaming Room." They expressed a need for a new online game that could run on different devices. The desired game was to resemble the existing Android game "Draw It or Lose It," involving showing drawings from a collection at a consistent speed for players, supporting several teams, and allowing players to guess the puzzle based on displayed images at various points in time.


## Documentation Development:
The documentation is well-structured and thorough. The executive summary effectively captures the client's vision and requirements. The clear breakdown of business and technical requirements, design constraints, system architecture view, domain model, evaluation of operating platforms, and detailed recommendations provides a comprehensive understanding of the project.

## Working through the Design Document:
Developing the documentation provided a roadmap for the software design process. The detailed requirements and constraints helped in understanding the scope and limitations. The system architecture view and domain model were particularly helpful in visualizing the structure of the application. This clarity facilitated a smoother transition from design to actual coding.

## Revision Choice:
If I were to revise one part of my work, I might focus on expanding the evaluation section. While I touched on the strengths and weaknesses of different operating platforms and mobile devices, providing more in-depth insights into potential challenges and benefits could enhance the decision-making process for the client.

## User Needs Implementation:
The interpretation of user needs was paramount in designing the software. By closely aligning with the client's requirements outlined in the documentation, such as game duration, platform compatibility, and security considerations, the design aimed to meet the end-users' expectations. Considering user needs is crucial as it ensures that the final product addresses the client's goals and provides a positive user experience.

## Approach to Software Design:
The approach to designing the software involved a systematic breakdown of business and technical requirements, followed by the creation of a domain model and system architecture view. Future software design endeavors could benefit from a more iterative approach, involving continuous feedback loops with the client to ensure evolving needs are met. Additionally, incorporating user interface design principles early in the process can enhance the overall user experience. Techniques such as prototyping and user testing can be integrated to gather feedback early in the development lifecycle, fostering a more user-centric design.
